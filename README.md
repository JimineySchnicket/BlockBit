# BlockBit
This repository contains all the server code for BlockBit, a currency on Scratch (created by me) which you can check out here:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/669020072/

## Files
**main.py** - Creates a thread for the API and a thread for the server.\
**Server.py** - All of the main server code is in this file. It handles transactions, saving and returning peoples' balances, and anything else related to the Scratch project. There are a decent number of comments there to help you understand it.\
**API.py** - All of the code for the API (a Flask app) is here.

## API Docs
(work in progress)
